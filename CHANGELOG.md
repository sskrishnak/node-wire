# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-27

First stable release. The public API is now **frozen under Semantic Versioning** —
see [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md) for the stability and deprecation
policy and [docs/public-api.md](docs/public-api.md) for the supported surface.

### Added

- Versioning, stability, and deprecation policy (`docs/versioning.md`).
- Public API reference enumerating the frozen surface (`docs/public-api.md`).
- `node_wire_runtime.__version__`.
- DCO sign-off enforcement, Dependabot, weekly secret scanning, and `SUPPORT` /
  `ROADMAP` / `GOVERNANCE` docs.
- Automated GitHub Release workflow with version and changelog validation, SBOM
  generation, release manifest generation, and GitHub release artifact upload.
- Tag-based PyPI publish workflow with release prerequisite checks, wheel checksum
  artifacts, and Sigstore attestations.
- CI badges in `README.md` and cross-platform pytest coverage on Linux, macOS,
  and Windows for Python 3.11 and 3.12.
- Test-coverage gate (`fail_under`) and updated security-audit install guidance
  for monorepo connector packages.

### Changed

- Promoted from Beta to **Production/Stable**; all nine packages versioned `1.0.0`.
- Connectors now require `node-wire-runtime>=1.0.0`.
- REST API authentication is now scoped to `/connectors/*` only. The playground UI
  (`/playground/*`), scenario API (`/scenarios/*`), and OpenAPI docs (`/docs`,
  `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`) are publicly accessible without credentials, making
  demo and discovery workflows viable when auth is enabled.
- Release and packaging documentation now use the `1.0.0` release flow and
  versioned MCP image examples.

### Fixed

- Connector authentication misconfiguration now surfaces clear, actionable error
  messages instead of cryptic library exceptions:
  - **OAuth2 private_key_jwt** (`oauth2.py`): `jwt.InvalidKeyError` is caught and
    re-raised with the algorithm and a pointer to the `private_key_secret`
    configuration.
  - **OAuth2 token endpoint** (`oauth2.py`): Non-200 responses from the token URL
    now include the HTTP status, the token URL, and a preview of the server
    response rather than a bare `raise_for_status()` traceback.
  - **Google service account** (`service_account.py`, `google_drive/logic.py`):
    Invalid JSON reports the secret name; a missing key file reports the resolved
    path; malformed key structures surface the underlying Google library error
    with context.
  - **SMTP** (`smtp/logic.py`): `SMTPAuthenticationError` names
    `SMTP_USERNAME`/`SMTP_PASSWORD`; connect/disconnect errors name
    `SMTP_HOST`/`SMTP_PORT`/`SMTP_USE_TLS`; timeout errors mention `NW_TIMEOUT`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Initial public release of the Node Wire platform: runtime, connectors, and bindings.
- Nine publishable Python packages: runtime plus eight connectors (HTTP generic, Google Drive, SMTP, Stripe, Epic FHIR, Cerner FHIR, Salesforce, Slack).
- REST, gRPC, and MCP entrypoints with authentication, scope policy, and observability hooks.
- Per-connector MCP Docker images and unified MCP server (`agents.mcp_entrypoint`).
- ToolHive agent scenario documentation and sample agent workflow.
- CI quality gates: Ruff, Mypy, pytest, Bandit, pip-audit, and REUSE compliance.
- Governance docs: contributing guide, security policy, code of conduct, privacy notes, and HIPAA considerations.

### Fixed

- gRPC protobuf stubs committed and importable for production startup.
- REST API no longer requires the optional `playground` package at import time.
- Dependency lockfile upgraded to resolve known CVEs in transitive packages.
- Packaging, publish workflow, and security scanning aligned on the nine-package surface.
