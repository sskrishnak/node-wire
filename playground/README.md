# Node Wire Playground

This folder contains a fully functional playground for **Node Wire**, showcasing how it orchestrates complex workflows across disparate systems like Electronic Health Records (EHR) and IT Service Management (ITSM) tools.

## 🚀 Overview

The demo provides a modern, interactive web interface to trigger, monitor, and verify end-to-end automation scenarios. It highlights the platform's ability to handle data mapping, authentication, and resource creation with transparency.

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), and Javascript.
- **Backend API**: FastAPI (Python) serving orchestration logic via `playground/scenarios.py`.
- **Connector Layer**: Integrated with `connectors` using the `fhir_epic`, `fhir_cerner`, and `http_generic` bindings.

## 📖 Scenarios & Implementation

### 🏥 Scenario 1: EHR Orchestration (Epic FHIR)
This scenario automates the process of synchronizing clinical notes from a third-party application into a patient's chart in Epic.

*   **Logic Flow**:
    1.  **Patient Discovery**: Reads patient details (Name, DOB, Patient ID) to verify identity in the EHR.
    2.  **Encounter Identification**: Searches for a matching "Finished" encounter (medical visit) for that patient.
    3.  **Clinical Note Upload**: Automatically encodes the clinical note as Base64 and creates a `DocumentReference` resource in Epic.
    4.  **Verification**: Re-queries the EHR to confirm the document's existence and displays the raw FHIR JSON response.
*   **Implementation**: Uses the `fhir_epic` connector, handling complex FHIR resource schemas and mapping internal data to US Core standards.

### 🛠️ Scenario 2: IT Ops Automation (Generic HTTP)
This scenario demonstrates how the platform can integrate with any REST-enabled legacy system or internal tool without requiring a specific connector.

*   **Logic Flow**:
    1.  **Payload Formatting**: Transforms user input into a standardized ITSM ticket schema.
    2.  **Dispatch Webhook**: Dispatches the payload via a standard REST `POST` request.
    3.  **Verification**: Simulates upstream acceptance and generates a unique tracking ID.
    4.  **Audit Log**: Triggers a background task to record the transaction in the system audit log.
*   **Implementation**: Uses the `http_generic` connector. In this demo, it targets `httpbin.org/post` to echo and verify the dispatched data, showcasing universal connectivity.

### 🛠️ Scenario 3: Cerner FHIR R4 Orchestration
This scenario demonstrates advanced clinical note orchestration for Oracle Health (Cerner) legacy systems, handling proprietary coding and strict validation rules.

*   **Logic Flow**:
    1.  **Identity Verification**: Verifies patient identity (e.g., Nancy Smart) using the `fhir_cerner` connector.
    2.  **Medical Visit Sync**: Locates specific encounters compatible with clinical documentation (e.g., `97957281`).
    3.  **Secure Clinical Sync**: Handles Cerner's specific requirements, including **CodeSet 72** document types, mandatory `docStatus`, and synchronized clinical periods to avoid temporal validation errors.
    4.  **EHR Verification**: Confirms the document creation by querying for the specific resource ID, ensuring it's properly indexed in the patient's record.
*   **Implementation**: Uses the `fhir_cerner` connector, demonstrating automated handling of Cerner's strict 422/400 validation rules (e.g., numeric practitioner IDs and specific search parameter combinations).

### 🔒 Scenario 4: Secure Document Archival (Google Drive Vault)
This scenario demonstrates secure archival of clinical documentation and incident reports into an access-controlled Google Drive Vault.

*   **Logic Flow**:
    1.  **Metadata Formatting**: Prepares strict schema mapping for the archival request including folder and recipient metadata.
    2.  **Upload to Secure Vault**: Pushes the plain-text confidentiality payload to Google Drive using `files.upload`.
    3.  **Establish Data Access**: Dynamically provisions reader IAM permissions for the designated recipient email using `permissions.create`.
    4.  **Verify Integrity**: Constructs a secure web-view link and retrieves access logs through `files.get`.
*   **Implementation**: Uses the `google_drive` connector loaded via `service_account.json` credentials, demonstrating how non-healthcare cloud platforms integrate seamlessly into the orchestration pipeline alongside FHIR standards.

### 🤖 Scenario 5: AI Agent Orchestration (MCP)
This scenario demonstrates the platform's highest level of abstraction: an autonomous AI Assistant that uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to orchestrate complex healthcare workflows through natural language.

*   **Logic Flow**:
    1.  **Autonomous Reasoning**: The agent parses user intent (e.g., "Get Nancy Smart's record and email it to her") using a Large Language Model (LLM).
    2.  **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Automatically selects and sequences tools from the **Node Wire MCP Server**, including Cerner FHIR, Google Drive, and SMTP.
    3.  **Guardrailed Execution**: Follows strict healthcare-specific guardrails, asking for missing patient IDs or confirmation before performing sensitive actions.
    4.  **Real-time Interaction**: Provides a chat interface with live step-by-step visibility into the agent's thought process and tool execution.
*   **Implementation**: Leverages the `agents` module, providing a unified interface for LLMs to interact with any connector in the platform via a standard MCP bridge.

## 🛠️ Advanced Platform Features

### 🛡️ Global Resilience Engine
Every request in the platform is now governed by an intelligent auto-retry mechanism.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatically retries failed requests with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s...) to handle transient network issues or rate limits.
- **Real-time Visibility**: The UI displays retry counts for each step, providing transparency when the platform is actively recovering from a system error.

### 🔍 Intelligent Error Classification
The platform distinguishes between different failure modes to provide actionable feedback:
- **BUSINESS**: Data validation or permission issues (e.g., "Patient not found").
- **RETRYABLE**: Transient system errors that the resilience engine can handle.
- **FATAL**: Critical infrastructure failures requiring manual intervention.
Errors are color-coded and clearly labeled in the "Technical Audit" panel.

## 🧪 Testing with Real Environments

The demo is pre-configured with mock/sandbox endpoints for immediate use. To test with real systems, follow these steps:

### Testing Real Epic/Cerner (EHR)
1.  **Update Config**: Modify `config/connectors.yaml` to point to a real Epic/Cerner Sandbox or Production URL.
2.  **Auth**: Ensure you have valid `CLIENT_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY` for the EHR's Backend System OAuth2 flow (SMART on FHIR).
3.  **Data**: Use real Patient IDs and Encounter IDs from your target environment. 
    - **Cerner Note**: Ensure you use numeric Practitioner IDs (e.g., `593923`) and valid CodeSet 72 codes.

### Testing Google Drive Vault (Manual End-to-End)
To test the Google Drive integration manually, follow these specialized setup steps:
1.  **Service Account**: Create a Service Account in the Google Cloud Console with the **Google Drive API** enabled. Download the JSON key.
2.  **Secret Configuration**:
    *   Place the JSON key file in your project directory (e.g., `**\node-wire\service_account.json`).
    *   Update your `.env` file: `google_drive_sa_json=**\node-wire\service_account.json`. 
    *   *Note: The platform now supports direct file paths for easier local configuration.*
3.  **Permissions**: If using a specific **Vault Folder ID**, ensure that folder is shared with the Service Account's email address (found in the JSON) with "Editor" or "Manager" permissions.
4.  **Workflow Verification**:
    *   **Direct Upload**: Drag a PDF or Image into the "Upload File" zone. Verify the file appears in the drive with correct metadata.
    *   **Note Archival**: Switch to "Write Note", type a clinical summary, and verify it is archived as a `.txt` file.
    *   **IAM Check**: Check the "Share" settings on the archived file in Google Drive; the "Recipient Email" specified in the UI should have been automatically added as a "Reader".

### 🤖 Configuring the AI Agent (Optional)
To enable the AI Agent chat, you need to configure an LLM provider:
1.  **Select Provider**: Set `LLM_PROVIDER` to `groq` (default) or `openai` in your `.env`.
2.  **Add API Key**: Provide the corresponding key, e.g., `GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here`.
3.  **SMTP Setup**: (Optional) Add SMTP credentials (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`) to enable the agent to send emails.
4.  **MCP URL**: (Optional) If running the MCP server in a separate container, set `TOOLHIVE_MCP_URL` to point to the MCP proxy.
