node_wire_runtime.auth.base
============================

Abstract base class for all authentication providers.

All authentication falls into two categories:

  Static Credentials  — fixed secrets (API keys, service-account JSON, SMTP passwords).
  Dynamic Tokens      — short-lived tokens that must be fetched and cached.

Both are unified behind this interface so connectors stay credential-agnostic.

    headers and :meth:`get_client_credentials` when they need SDK-level
